          information:
            You can import past payments which are not registered by 
            <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manage/supportreceived">downloading a CSV from Ko-fi</a>,
            and upload it here. Only received payments which are unknown will be added to the database.
            Already known payments will be ignored.<br /><br />
            As the CSV export does not contain information if the user wanted to have this information public, all
            payments will be imported as private.

        anonymize:
          title: Anonymize
          description: Remove personal identifiable information from payments.
          information:
            When you anonymize a Discourse user account it will automatically anonymize all Ko-fi Payments
            registered in the database, and also future received payment.<br />
            For existing accounts, associated with Discourse users, you can also individually anonymize
            associated accounts from the accounts screen.<br />
            When you receive a request to forget a person, you can use this forum to create an anonymized account
            for this email address and thereby anonymize all previous and future payments.<br /><br />
            When anonymizing payments all identifiable information will be removed, including the original used
            email address. The original email address will be pseudo-anonymized by hashing it using SHA2, this allows
            for matching with future payments.<br /><br />
            Anonymization of payments is non-reversible. Deleting an anonymized account will allow new payments to
            be matched with a user, but past payments cannot be matched.
